## Register merchant system and create monetized role
Command bellow will create Discord Guild Profile into the system
```text

```

Once you successfully register into the merchant system its time to monetize your community.

### Step 1 -> Create role and assign parameters

When creating monetized role following details are required to be provided to the system 

- Role Name -> No longer than 10 Characters in length and no special characters allowed
- Dollar value -> Dollar value of the role which will be used for conversion to XLM when purchase is initiated
- Duration parameters required to be set in order like shown in command bellow and only integer allowed. Infinite role 
is at this point not allowed. At least one of the chronological parameters needs to be greater than 1. 

    - ***Weeks*** - Integer number 
    - ***Days*** - Integer number
    - ***Hours*** - Integer number
    - ***Minutes*** - Integer number
    
```text
!merchant create_role <role name> <value in $> <weeks> <days> <hours> <minutes>
```
Examples:
```text
!merchant create_role Weekly 100 1 0 0 0  # monetized role with name Weekly in value 100$ for 1 week.
```
If everything goes well you should receive notification from the system on successfull creation. 

### Step 2 Activate role for purchase
```text
!merchant start_role <@discord.Role>
```

Referencing to step 1 example would be:
```text
!merchant start_role @weekly
```
