# About Crypto Link
Crypto Link is a multi-functional & multi-guild Discord bot serving as a bridge between the Stellar Ecosystem and 
Discord users. Being built ontop of the Stellar Blockchain, it utilizes the native token, Stellar Lumen (a.k.a XLM) 
and tokens issued on Stellar chain, allowing for execution of Peer to Peer transactions amongst users, monetization
opportunities for Discord guild owners and project promotions/crowdfunding/ICOs activities at low costs for aspiring
fintech-companies building with the help of Stellar.
