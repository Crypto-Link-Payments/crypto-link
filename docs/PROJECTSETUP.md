#How to setup project and development environment

## Discord integration instructions
In order to be able to use the bot it needs to be integrated into Discord Community. You can either create your
own guild on Discord and use it as testing environment or than join Crypto Link Community and contact staff. They will
dedicate a special channel for your bot instance so you can at the same time showcase your contribution to the staff.
Staff and request can be also requested through email cryptolinkpayments@gmail.com

### Developer account
Got to [Discord Developer](https://discord.com/developers) page and register for developer account.

### Create Bot Instance
Once Successfully registered you need to create new application to get ***ID*** and create bot by going to 
***Bot*** --> ***Add Bot***. Once everything successfully created, store ***Bot token*** and ***ID*** as you will need 
them as well when setting up .json files on next sections. Create bot invite link from 
[Permission calculator site](https://discordapi.com/permissions.html). In order for bot to function optimally following
permissions are required:

> - [X] Manage Roles
> - [X] Manage Emojis
> - [X] Read Message
> - [X] Send Message
> - [X] Manage Message
> - [X] Embed Links
> - [X] Attach Files
> - [X] Read message history
> - [X] Use external Emojis
> - [X] Add reactions

Once everything selected at the bottom select client link and invite link will be automatically generated for you.
